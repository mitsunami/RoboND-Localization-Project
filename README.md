# RoboND-Localization-Project
## Abstract
Robot localization denotes the robot's ability to establish its own position and orientation within the frame of reference. This project is for building mobile robots and integrating them with Gazebo and RViz by developing a ROS package for those robots. Additionally, the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) package and the Navigation Stack are integrated, that would allow robots to navigate and localize itself in a particular map. And then, navigation behavior is improved by tuning parameters corresponding to these packages.
